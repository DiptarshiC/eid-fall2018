"""example.py: This is an example of documenting a Python module.

This part is called a docstring.  It can be multiple lines, or
a single line ended with the triple quote.  Generally there should be
docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
Non-public methods should at least have a comment that describes what
the method does.  (See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ for more information.)

When a doc string is used, this will be information will be available as the __doc__
attribute for this module.  

On the python command line, you could type
>>> import example
>>> help(example)
and it would print out this docstring.
